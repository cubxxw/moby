## v1.52 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.52](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.52/) documentation

* `GET /images/{name}/get` now accepts multiple `platform` query-arguments
  to allow selecting which platform(s) of a multi-platform image must be
  saved.
* `POST /images/load` now accepts multiple `platform` query-arguments
  to allow selecting which platform(s) of a multi-platform image to load.

## v1.51 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.51](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.51/) documentation

* `GET /images/json` now sets the value of `Containers` field for all images
  to the count of containers using the image.
  This field was previously always -1.

## v1.50 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.50](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.50/) documentation

* `GET /info` now includes a `DiscoveredDevices` field. This is an array of
  `DeviceInfo` objects, each providing details about a device discovered by a
  device driver.
  Currently only the CDI device driver is supported.
* `DELETE /images/{name}` now supports a `platforms` query parameter. It accepts
  an array of JSON-encoded OCI Platform objects, allowing for selecting specific
  platforms to delete content for.
* Deprecated: The `BridgeNfIptables` and `BridgeNfIp6tables` fields in the
  `GET /info` response were deprecated in API v1.48, and are now omitted
  in API v1.50.
* Deprecated: `GET /images/{name}/json` no longer returns the following `Config`
  fields; `Hostname`, `Domainname`, `AttachStdin`, `AttachStdout`, `AttachStderr`
  `Tty`, `OpenStdin`, `StdinOnce`, `Image`, `NetworkDisabled` (already omitted unless set),
  `MacAddress` (already omitted unless set), `StopTimeout` (already omitted unless set).
  These additional fields were included in the response due to an implementation
  detail but not part of the image's Configuration. These fields were marked
  deprecated in API v1.46, and are now omitted. Older versions of the API still
  return these fields, but they are always empty.

## v1.49 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.49](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.49/) documentation

* `GET /images/{name}/json` now supports a `platform` parameter (JSON
  encoded OCI Platform type) allowing to specify a platform of the multi-platform
  image to inspect.
  This option is mutually exclusive with the `manifests` option.
* `GET /info` now returns a `FirewallBackend` containing information about
  the daemon's firewalling configuration.
* Deprecated: The  `AllowNondistributableArtifactsCIDRs` and `AllowNondistributableArtifactsHostnames`
  fields in the `RegistryConfig` struct in the `GET /info` response are omitted
  in API v1.49.
* Deprecated: The `ContainerdCommit.Expected`, `RuncCommit.Expected`, and
  `InitCommit.Expected` fields in the `GET /info` endpoint were deprecated
  in API v1.48, and are now omitted in API v1.49.

## v1.48 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.48](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.48/) documentation

* Deprecated: The "error" and "progress" fields in streaming responses for
  endpoints that return a JSON progress response, such as `POST /images/create`,
  `POST /images/{name}/push`, and `POST /build` are deprecated. These fields
  were marked deprecated in API v1.4 (docker v0.6.0) and API v1.8 (docker v0.7.1)
  respectively, but still returned. These fields will be left empty or will
  be omitted in a future API version. Users should use the information in the
  `errorDetail` and `progressDetail` fields instead.
* Deprecated: The "allow-nondistributable-artifacts" daemon configuration is
  deprecated and enabled by default. The  `AllowNondistributableArtifactsCIDRs`
  and `AllowNondistributableArtifactsHostnames` fields in the `RegistryConfig`
  struct in the `GET /info` response will now always be `null` and will be
  omitted in API v1.49.
* Deprecated: The `BridgeNfIptables` and `BridgeNfIp6tables` fields in the 
  `GET /info` response are now always be `false` and will be omitted in API
  v1.49. The netfilter module is now loaded on-demand, and no longer during
  daemon startup, making these fields obsolete.
* `GET /images/{name}/history` now supports a `platform` parameter (JSON
  encoded OCI Platform type) that allows to specify a platform to show the
  history of.
* `POST /images/{name}/load` and `GET /images/{name}/get` now support a
  `platform` parameter (JSON encoded OCI Platform type) that allows to specify
  a platform to load/save. Not passing this parameter will result in
  loading/saving the full multi-platform image.
* `POST /containers/create` now includes a warning in the response when setting
  the container-wide `Config.VolumeDriver` option in combination with volumes
  defined through `Mounts` because the `VolumeDriver` option has no effect on
  those volumes. This warning was previously generated by the CLI, but now
  moved to the daemon so that other clients can also get this warning.
* `POST /containers/create` now supports `Mount` of type `image` for mounting
  an image inside a container.
* Deprecated: The `ContainerdCommit.Expected`, `RuncCommit.Expected`, and
  `InitCommit.Expected` fields in the `GET /info` endpoint are deprecated
  and will be omitted in API v1.49.
* `Sysctls` in `HostConfig` (top level `--sysctl` settings) for `eth0` are
  no longer migrated to `DriverOpts`, as described in the changes for v1.46.
* `GET /images/json` and `GET /images/{name}/json` responses now include
  `Descriptor` field, which contains an OCI descriptor of the image target.
  The new field will only be populated if the daemon provides a multi-platform
  image store.
  WARNING: This is experimental and may change at any time without any backward
  compatibility.
* `GET /images/{name}/json` response now will return the `Manifests` field
  containing information about the sub-manifests contained in the image index.
  This includes things like platform-specific manifests and build attestations.
  The new field will only be populated if the request also sets the `manifests`
  query parameter to `true`.
  This acts the same as in the `GET /images/json` endpoint.
  WARNING: This is experimental and may change at any time without any backward compatibility.
* `GET /containers/{name}/json` now returns an `ImageManifestDescriptor` field
  containing the OCI descriptor of the platform-specific image manifest of the
  image that was used to create the container.
  This field is only populated if the daemon provides a multi-platform image
  store.
* `POST /networks/create` now has an `EnableIPv4` field. Setting it to `false`
  disables IPv4 IPAM for the network. It can only be set to `false` if the
  daemon has experimental features enabled.
* `GET /networks/{id}` now returns an `EnableIPv4` field showing whether the
  network has IPv4 IPAM enabled.
* `POST /networks/{id}/connect` and `POST /containers/create` now accept a
  `GwPriority` field in `EndpointsConfig`. This value is used to determine which
  network endpoint provides the default gateway for the container. The endpoint
  with the highest priority is selected. If multiple endpoints have the same
  priority, endpoints are sorted lexicographically by their network name, and
  the one that sorts first is picked.
* `GET /containers/json` now returns a `GwPriority` field in `NetworkSettings`
  for each network endpoint.
* API debug endpoints (`GET /debug/vars`, `GET /debug/pprof/`, `GET /debug/pprof/cmdline`,
  `GET /debug/pprof/profile`, `GET /debug/pprof/symbol`, `GET /debug/pprof/trace`,
  `GET /debug/pprof/{name}`) are now also accessible through the versioned-API
  paths (`/v<API-version>/<endpoint>`).
* `POST /build/prune` renames `keep-bytes` to `reserved-space` and now supports
  additional prune parameters `max-used-space` and `min-free-space`.
* `GET /containers/json` now returns an `ImageManifestDescriptor` field
  matching the same field in `/containers/{name}/json`.
  This field is only populated if the daemon provides a multi-platform image
  store.

## v1.47 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.47](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.47/) documentation

* `GET /images/json` response now includes `Manifests` field, which contains
  information about the sub-manifests included in the image index. This
  includes things like platform-specific manifests and build attestations.
  The new field will only be populated if the request also sets the `manifests`
  query parameter to `true`.
  WARNING: This is experimental and may change at any time without any backward
  compatibility.
* `GET /info` no longer includes warnings when `bridge-nf-call-iptables` or
  `bridge-nf-call-ip6tables` are disabled when the daemon was started. The
  `br_netfilter` module is now attempted to be loaded when needed, making those
  warnings inaccurate. This change is not versioned, and affects all API versions
  if the daemon has this patch.

## v1.46 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.46](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.46/) documentation

* `GET /info` now includes a `Containerd` field containing information about
  the location of the containerd API socket and containerd namespaces used
  by the daemon to run containers and plugins.
* `POST /containers/create` field `NetworkingConfig.EndpointsConfig.DriverOpts`,
  and `POST /networks/{id}/connect` field `EndpointsConfig.DriverOpts`, now
  support label `com.docker.network.endpoint.sysctls` for setting per-interface
  sysctls. The value is a comma separated list of sysctl assignments, the
  interface name must be "IFNAME". For example, to set
  `net.ipv4.config.eth0.log_martians=1`, use
  `net.ipv4.config.IFNAME.log_martians=1`. In API versions up-to 1.46, top level
  `--sysctl` settings for `eth0` will be migrated to `DriverOpts` when possible. 
  This automatic migration will be removed in a future release.
* `GET /containers/json` now returns the annotations of containers.
* `POST /images/{name}/push` now supports a `platform` parameter (JSON encoded
  OCI Platform type) that allows selecting a specific platform manifest from
  the multi-platform image.
* `POST /containers/create` now takes `Options` as part of `HostConfig.Mounts.TmpfsOptions` to set options for tmpfs mounts.
* `POST /services/create` now takes `Options` as part of `ContainerSpec.Mounts.TmpfsOptions`, to set options for tmpfs mounts.
* `GET /events` now supports image `create` event that is emitted when a new
  image is built regardless if it was tagged or not.

### Deprecated Config fields in `GET /images/{name}/json` response

The `Config` field returned by this endpoint (used for "image inspect") returns
additional fields that are not part of the image's configuration and not part of
the [Docker Image Spec] and the [OCI Image Spec].

These additional fields are included in the response, due to an
implementation detail, where the [api/types.ImageInspec] type used
for the response is using the [container.Config] type.

The [container.Config] type is a superset of the image config, and while the
image's Config is used as a _template_ for containers created from the image,
the additional fields are set at runtime (from options passed when creating
the container) and not taken from the image Config.

These fields are never set (and always return the default value for the type),
but are not omitted in the response when left empty. As these fields were not
intended to be part of the image configuration response, they are deprecated,
and will be removed from the API.

The following fields are currently included in the API response, but
are not part of the underlying image's Config, and deprecated:

- `Hostname`
- `Domainname`
- `AttachStdin`
- `AttachStdout`
- `AttachStderr`
- `Tty`
- `OpenStdin`
- `StdinOnce`
- `Image`
- `NetworkDisabled` (already omitted unless set)
- `MacAddress` (already omitted unless set)
- `StopTimeout` (already omitted unless set)

[OCI Image Spec]: https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/v1.1.0/specs-go/v1/config.go#L24-L62
[api/types.ImageInspec]: https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/v26.1.4/api/types/types.go#L87-L104
[container.Config]: https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/v26.1.4/api/types/container/config.go#L47-L82

* `POST /services/create` and `POST /services/{id}/update` now support OomScoreAdj

## v1.45 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.45](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.45/) documentation

* `POST /containers/create` now supports `VolumeOptions.Subpath` which allows a
  subpath of a named volume to be mounted.
* `POST /images/search` will always assume a `false` value for the `is-automated`
  field. Consequently, searching for `is-automated=true` will yield no results,
  while `is-automated=false` will be a no-op.
* `GET /images/{name}/json` no longer includes the `Container` and
  `ContainerConfig` fields. To access image configuration, use `Config` field
  instead.
* The `Aliases` field returned in calls to `GET /containers/{name:.*}/json` no
  longer contains the short container ID, but instead will reflect exactly the
  values originally submitted to the `POST /containers/create` endpoint. The
  newly introduced `DNSNames` should now be used instead when short container
  IDs are needed.

## v1.44 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.44](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.44/) documentation

* GET `/images/json` now accepts an `until` filter. This accepts a timestamp and
  lists all images created before it. The `<timestamp>` can be Unix timestamps,
  date formatted timestamps, or Go duration strings (e.g. `10m`, `1h30m`)
  computed relative to the daemon machine’s time. This change is not versioned,
  and affects all API versions if the daemon has this patch.
* The `VirtualSize` field in the `GET /images/{name}/json`, `GET /images/json`,
  and `GET /system/df` responses is now omitted. Use the `Size` field instead,
  which contains the same information.
* Deprecated: The `is_automated` field in the `GET /images/search` response has
  been deprecated and will always be set to false in the future because Docker
  Hub is deprecating the `is_automated` field in its search API. The deprecation
  is not versioned, and applies to all API versions.
* Deprecated: The `is-automated` filter for the `GET /images/search` endpoint.
  The `is_automated` field has been deprecated by Docker Hub's search API.
  Consequently, searching for `is-automated=true` will yield no results. The
  deprecation is not versioned, and applies to all API versions.
* Read-only bind mounts are now made recursively read-only on kernel >= 5.12
  with runtimes which support the feature.
  `POST /containers/create`, `GET /containers/{id}/json`, and `GET /containers/json` now supports
  `BindOptions.ReadOnlyNonRecursive` and `BindOptions.ReadOnlyForceRecursive` to customize the behavior.
* `POST /containers/create` now accepts a `HealthConfig.StartInterval` to set the
  interval for health checks during the start period.
* `GET /info` now includes a `CDISpecDirs` field indicating the configured CDI
  specifications directories. The use of the applied setting requires the daemon
  to have experimental enabled, and for non-experimental daemons an empty list is
  always returned.
* `POST /networks/create` now returns a 400 if the `IPAMConfig` has invalid
  values. Note that this change is _unversioned_ and applied to all API
  versions on daemon that support version 1.44.
* `POST /networks/create` with a duplicated name now fails systematically. As
  such, the `CheckDuplicate` field is now deprecated. Note that this change is
  _unversioned_ and applied to all API versions on daemon that support version
  1.44.
* `POST /containers/create` now accepts multiple `EndpointSettings` in
  `NetworkingConfig.EndpointSettings`.
* `POST /containers/create` and `POST /networks/{id}/connect` will now catch
  validation errors that were previously only returned during `POST /containers/{id}/start`.
  These endpoints will also return the full set of validation errors they find,
  instead of returning only the first one.
  Note that this change is _unversioned_ and applies to all API versions.
* `POST /services/create` and `POST /services/{id}/update` now accept `Seccomp`
  and `AppArmor` fields in the `ContainerSpec.Privileges` object. This allows
  some configuration of Seccomp and AppArmor in Swarm services.
* A new endpoint-specific `MacAddress` field has been added to `NetworkSettings.EndpointSettings`
  on `POST /containers/create`, and to `EndpointConfig` on `POST /networks/{id}/connect`.
  The container-wide `MacAddress` field in `Config`, on `POST /containers/create`, is now deprecated.
* The field `Networks` in the `POST /services/create` and `POST /services/{id}/update`
  requests is now deprecated. You should instead use the field `TaskTemplate.Networks`.
* The `Container` and `ContainerConfig` fields in the `GET /images/{name}/json`
  response are deprecated and will no longer be included in API v1.45.
* `GET /info` now includes `status` properties in `Runtimes`.
* A new field named `DNSNames` and containing all non-fully qualified DNS names
  a container takes on a specific network has been added to `GET /containers/{name:.*}/json`.
* The `Aliases` field returned in calls to `GET /containers/{name:.*}/json` in v1.44 and older
  versions contains the short container ID. This will change in the next API version, v1.45.
  Starting with that API version, this specific value will be removed from the `Aliases` field
  such that this field will reflect exactly the values originally submitted to the
  `POST /containers/create` endpoint. The newly introduced `DNSNames` should now be used instead.
* The fields `HairpinMode`, `LinkLocalIPv6Address`, `LinkLocalIPv6PrefixLen`, `SecondaryIPAddresses`,
  `SecondaryIPv6Addresses` available in `NetworkSettings` when calling `GET /containers/{id}/json` are
  deprecated and will be removed in a future release. You should instead look for the default network in
  `NetworkSettings.Networks`.
* `GET /images/{id}/json` omits the `Created` field (previously it was `0001-01-01T00:00:00Z`)
  if the `Created` field is missing from the image config.

## v1.43 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.43](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.43/) documentation

* `POST /containers/create` now accepts `Annotations` as part of `HostConfig`.
  Can be used to attach arbitrary metadata to the container, which will also be
  passed to the runtime when the container is started.
* `GET /images/json` no longer includes hardcoded `<none>:<none>` and
  `<none>@<none>` in `RepoTags` and`RepoDigests` for untagged images.
  In such cases, empty arrays will be produced instead.
* The `VirtualSize` field in the `GET /images/{name}/json`, `GET /images/json`,
  and `GET /system/df` responses is deprecated and will no longer be included
  in API v1.44. Use the `Size` field instead, which contains the same information.
* `GET /info` now includes `no-new-privileges` in the `SecurityOptions` string
  list when this option is enabled globally. This change is not versioned, and
  affects all API versions if the daemon has this patch.

## v1.42 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.42](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.42/) documentation

* Removed the `BuilderSize` field on the `GET /system/df` endpoint. This field
  was introduced in API 1.31 as part of an experimental feature, and no longer
  used since API 1.40.
  Use field `BuildCache` instead to track storage used by the builder component.
* `POST /containers/{id}/stop` and `POST /containers/{id}/restart` now accept a
  `signal` query parameter, which allows overriding the container's default stop-
  signal.
* `GET /images/json` now accepts query parameter `shared-size`. When set `true`,
  images returned will include `SharedSize`, which provides the size on disk shared
  with other images present on the system.
* `GET /system/df` now accepts query parameter `type`. When set,
  computes and returns data only for the specified object type.
  The parameter can be specified multiple times to select several object types.
  Supported values are: `container`, `image`, `volume`, `build-cache`.
* `GET /system/df` can now be used concurrently. If a request is made while a
  previous request is still being processed, the request will receive the result
  of the already running calculation, once completed. Previously, an error
  (`a disk usage operation is already running`) would be returned in this
  situation. This change is not versioned, and affects all API versions if the
  daemon has this patch.
* The `POST /images/create` now supports both the operating system and architecture
  that is passed through the `platform` query parameter when using the `fromSrc`
  option to import an image from an archive. Previously, only the operating system
  was used and the architecture was ignored. If no `platform` option is set, the
  host's operating system and architecture as used as default. This change is not
  versioned, and affects all API versions if the daemon has this patch.
* The `POST /containers/{id}/wait` endpoint now returns a `400` status code if an
  invalid `condition` is provided (on API 1.30 and up).
* Removed the `KernelMemory` field from the `POST /containers/create` and
  `POST /containers/{id}/update` endpoints, any value it is set to will be ignored
  on API version `v1.42` and up. Older API versions still accept this field, but
  may take no effect, depending on the kernel version and OCI runtime in use.
* `GET /containers/{id}/json` now omits the `KernelMemory` and `KernelMemoryTCP`
  if they are not set.
* `GET /info` now omits the `KernelMemory` and `KernelMemoryTCP` if they are not
  supported by the host or host's configuration (if cgroups v2 are in use).
* `GET /_ping` and `HEAD /_ping` now return `Builder-Version` by default.
  This header contains the default builder to use, and is a recommendation as
  advertised by the daemon. However, it is up to the client to choose which builder
  to use.

  The default value on Linux is version "2" (BuildKit), but the daemon can be
  configured to recommend version "1" (classic Builder). Windows does not yet
  support BuildKit for native Windows images, and uses "1" (classic builder) as
  a default.

  This change is not versioned, and affects all API versions if the daemon has
  this patch.
* `GET /_ping` and `HEAD /_ping` now return a `Swarm` header, which allows a
  client to detect if Swarm is enabled on the daemon, without having to call
  additional endpoints.
  This change is not versioned, and affects all API versions if the daemon has
  this patch. Clients must consider this header "optional", and fall back to
  using other endpoints to get this information if the header is not present.

  The `Swarm` header can contain one of the following values:

    - "inactive"
    - "pending"
    - "error"
    - "locked"
    - "active/worker"
    - "active/manager"
* `POST /containers/create` for Windows containers now accepts a new syntax in
  `HostConfig.Resources.Devices.PathOnHost`. As well as the existing `class/<GUID>`
  syntax, `<IDType>://<ID>` is now recognised. Support for specific `<IDType>` values
  depends on the underlying implementation and Windows version. This change is not
  versioned, and affects all API versions if the daemon has this patch.
* `GET /containers/{id}/attach`, `GET /exec/{id}/start`, `GET /containers/{id}/logs`
  `GET /services/{id}/logs` and `GET /tasks/{id}/logs` now set Content-Type header
  to `application/vnd.docker.multiplexed-stream` when a multiplexed stdout/stderr
  stream is sent to client, `application/vnd.docker.raw-stream` otherwise.
* `POST /volumes/create` now accepts a new `ClusterVolumeSpec` to create a cluster
  volume (CNI). This option can only be used if the daemon is a Swarm manager.
  The Volume response on creation now also can contain a `ClusterVolume` field
  with information about the created volume.
* The `BuildCache.Parent` field, as returned by `GET /system/df` is deprecated
  and is now omitted. API versions before v1.42 continue to include this field.
* `GET /system/df` now includes a new `Parents` field, for "build-cache" records,
  which contains a list of parent IDs for the build-cache record.
* Volume information returned by `GET /volumes/{name}`, `GET /volumes` and
  `GET /system/df` can now contain a `ClusterVolume` if the volume is a cluster
  volume (requires the daemon to be a Swarm manager).
* The `Volume` type, as returned by `Added new `ClusterVolume` fields
* Added a new `PUT /volumes{name}` endpoint to update cluster volumes (CNI).
  Cluster volumes are only supported if the daemon is a Swarm manager.
* `GET /containers/{name}/attach/ws` endpoint now accepts `stdin`, `stdout` and
  `stderr` query parameters to only attach to configured streams.

  NOTE: These parameters were documented before in older API versions, but not
  actually supported. API versions before v1.42 continue to ignore these parameters
  and default to attaching to all streams. To preserve the pre-v1.42 behavior,
  set all three query parameters (`?stdin=1,stdout=1,stderr=1`).
* `POST /containers/create` on Linux now respects the `HostConfig.ConsoleSize` property.
  Container is immediately created with the desired terminal size and clients no longer
  need to set the desired size on their own.
* `POST /containers/create` allow to set `CreateMountpoint` for host path to be
  created if missing. This brings parity with `Binds`
* `POST /containers/create` rejects request if BindOptions|VolumeOptions|TmpfsOptions
  is set with a non-matching mount Type.
* `POST /containers/{id}/exec` now accepts an optional `ConsoleSize` parameter.
  It allows to set the console size of the executed process immediately when it's created.
* `POST /volumes/prune` will now only prune "anonymous" volumes (volumes which were not given a name) by default. A new filter parameter `all` can be set to a truth-y value (`true`, `1`) to get the old behavior.

## v1.41 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.41](https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/engine/version/v1.41/) documentation

* `GET /events` now returns `prune` events after pruning resources have completed.
  Prune events are returned for `container`, `network`, `volume`, `image`, and
  `builder`, and have a `reclaimed` attribute, indicating the amount of space
  reclaimed (in bytes).
* `GET /info` now returns a `CgroupVersion` field, containing the cgroup version.
* `GET /info` now returns a `DefaultAddressPools` field, containing a list of
  custom default address pools for local networks, which can be specified in the
  `daemon.json` file or `--default-address-pool` dockerd option.
* `POST /services/create` and `POST /services/{id}/update` now supports `BindOptions.NonRecursive`.
* The `ClusterStore` and `ClusterAdvertise` fields in `GET /info` are deprecated
  and are now omitted if they contain an empty value. This change is not versioned,
  and affects all API versions if the daemon has this patch.
* The `filter` (singular) query parameter, which was deprecated in favor of the
  `filters` option in Docker 1.13, has now been removed from the `GET /images/json`
  endpoint. The parameter remains available when using API version 1.40 or below.
* `GET /services` now returns `CapAdd` and `CapDrop` as part of the `ContainerSpec`.
* `GET /services/{id}` now returns `CapAdd` and `CapDrop` as part of the `ContainerSpec`.
* `POST /services/create` now accepts `CapAdd` and `CapDrop` as part of the `ContainerSpec`.
* `POST /services/{id}/update` now accepts `CapAdd` and `CapDrop` as part of the `ContainerSpec`.
* `GET /tasks` now  returns `CapAdd` and `CapDrop` as part of the `ContainerSpec`.
* `GET /tasks/{id}` now  returns `CapAdd` and `CapDrop` as part of the `ContainerSpec`.
* `GET /services` now returns `Pids` in `TaskTemplate.Resources.Limits`.

  When set, the daemon checks if the requested image is present in the local image
  cache with the given OS and Architecture, and otherwise returns a `404` status.

  If the option is _not_ set, the host's native OS and Architecture are used to
  look up the image in the image cache. However, if no platform is passed and the
  given image _does_ exist in the local image cache, but its OS or architecture
  do not match, the container is created with the available image, and a warning
  is added to the `Warnings` field in the response, for example;

      WARNING: The requested image's platform (linux/arm64/v8) does not
               match the detected host platform (linux/amd64) and no
               specific platform was requested

* `POST /containers/create` on Linux now accepts the `HostConfig.CgroupnsMode` property.
  Set the property to `host` to create the container in the daemon's cgroup namespace, or
  `private` to create the container in its own private cgroup namespace.  The per-daemon
  default is `host`, and can be changed by using the`CgroupNamespaceMode` daemon configuration
  parameter.
